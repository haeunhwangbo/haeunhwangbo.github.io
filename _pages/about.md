Hi, My name is Haeun (Hannah) Hannah Hwangbo. I am a Ph.D. candidate studying **Bioinformatics & Computational Biology** at UNC-Chapel Hill. My current research is focused on the effect of cancer combination therapies in large heterogenous patient populations. I am passionate about translational/clinical reasearch, especially how we can improve treatment options for patients.

Outside research, I love playing tennis, and I (used to) upload travel vlogs on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjRadUEZXN-Xs_6Qvd11bQ).
